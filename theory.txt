COLLECTION TOPIC PYTHON:-

1)LIST 2)TUPEL AND 3)DICTIONARY:-

1)LIST:-
   
  - list is collection data type which is contain similar and dis-similar data type
    element in single-location.
  - list which is presnted by [] braces.
  - list is indexble,sequence data type,orderable,mutable(we can change it)
  - list can contain duplicate element

  syntax:
   var=[]


LIST METHOD:
-append():
using of append method we can store data in existing list append add a new element
at end of the list.

syntax:
list.append(new_element)

-extend():
using of extend method we can store one or more element at one time in extisting ist.

syntax:
list.extend([element1],[element2],.....)

-insert():
using of insert method we can store element at specific index position.

syntax:
list.insert(index,new_element)

list indexing:-
->list indexing :- by default list always start- from 0
    0   1  2  3  4
l1=[10,20,30,40,50]
    -5 -4 -3 -2 -1

METHOD LIST:
-remove():
using of remove method we can remove - element from the list.

syntax:
l1.remove("element")

-pop():
using of pop method we can remove index-element of list.

syntax:
l1.pop()

-clear():
using of clear method we can remove all-element from the existing list.

syntax:
l1.clear()

-del():
using of del keyword we can deleet from the memory.

syntax:
del l1

-index():
using index method we can find out specific index position of element.

syntax:
list.index(value)



(2)tuple:
- tupale is a collection dtata type which is contain similar and dis-similar data element
-tuple which is represent by () braces.

- tupale which is orderable,indexable,but immuteble
in tuple we cant not change it value.

- so tuple does not have append,remove,kind of method.

set method:
-   set is a collection data type witch is represent by {} braces.
-   set which is unorderable,unindexable,immuteble.
-   if we want to remove duplicate element from the set we can use set.
  
   #set: not impotant topic
   #set:me add kar sakte he method se par change nhi kar sakte.

   #immutable: mins change add modifiy but set is immutable.
